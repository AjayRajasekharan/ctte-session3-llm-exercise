WHAT IS RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION (RAG)?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation, or RAG, is a technique that combines
information retrieval with text generation.

Instead of relying only on what a language model already knows,
RAG allows the model to look up relevant information from external documents.

Steps in RAG:
1. The user asks a question.
2. The system searches a document database for relevant text.
3. The most relevant text chunks are retrieved.
4. These chunks are provided as context to the language model.
5. The model generates an answer based on the retrieved context.

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations
- Allows answers based on custom or private data
- Keeps models lightweight while adding knowledge

Limitations:
- Answers are only as good as the uploaded documents
- Poor document quality leads to poor answers
